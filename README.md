# Tijaarat.com  

Tijaarat.com is a *front-end prototype* of a business networking platform where users can chat, explore supplier recommendations, view smart analytics, and build trust networks.

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for styling (custom theme variables, responsive layouts)  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)** for interactivity  
- **Google Fonts & FontAwesome** via CDN  

---

## ⚠️ Notes & Next Steps  

- Some sections include `...` placeholders — these can be completed with additional logic or API integrations.  
- Demo data (contacts, products, suppliers, trust scores) is hard-coded in JavaScript. Replace with real API data when backend is available.  
- User input in chat currently uses `innerHTML` → should be sanitized before connecting to a live server (potential XSS risk).  
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, alt attributes) are recommended for production.
